        <title>Forgot creating an AppConfig file, not a problem !!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINISHED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Task 1: Changed the interface to accept either of the AppConfig file or the individually selected weights&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Task 2: Integrated it with suite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TO-DO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Task 1: Yet to convert the ListView to Dropdown.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Task 2: Yet to add filterting option to deployer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently , in order to run the App , you must pass a config
file that has the paths of different required parameters stored
in them. So to make the End-user experience more
friendly , effort has been made to create Graphical User
Interface which pops up when the config file is not passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL-LOOK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The final interface of the GUI at the end of the day is as shown below
&lt;img src=&quot;/hacker-blog/img/week3_1.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;drawing&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As can be seen above, it has two parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can select the required parameters individually on the go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or you could also pass a config file in case if you have one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;first-case--selecting-the-required-parameters-graphically&quot;&gt;First case : Selecting the required parameters graphically&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While using the App for the first time , many users might forget
to provide a config file as required by the app, sometimes
people who are new to Linux might even find it difficult to
create/pass the config file. So to make the app more user
friendly and start it without going through the hastle of
creating a config file , a GUI has been made using which the
user can select them. Upon not selecting all the parameters it
also displays a warning box as shown.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/hacker-blog/img/week3_3.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;drawing&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The video for the same can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0A6RozhIfgY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While going through the codebase regarding how things are
implemented , it was observerd that the provide &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.yml&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is
converted to a yaml node. So code has been written to return
a yaml node which has the same key:value structure as it were
if a config file has been passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;second-case--selecting-the-config-file-graphically&quot;&gt;Second case : Selecting the config file graphically&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already created a config file , and just forgot to pass
it or it exists but not in the same directory and you are lazy
enough to not pass the entire path, no worries you can just
select the config file only instead of all the required
parameters individually. And this, similar to the above part
pop up an error message if no file is selected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/hacker-blog/img/week3_2.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;drawing&quot; /&gt;  f
The video for the same can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/F9NTfS6ussg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementation-1&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a config file is passed , the file is then searched to obtain
it’s entire filepath , which later is used in creating a
yaml::node. So basically we need to provide the filepath to the
function which creates the node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;upcomming-tasks&quot;&gt;Upcomming tasks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enable support to use the original darknet framework instead of
a modified one which is currently being used. And upon
completion implement the filtering and Dropdown options of this
week(yet to decide).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Unexpected Week</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;week-2-transition-from-a-bad-start-to-regaining-confidence&quot;&gt;Week 2: Transition from a bad start to regaining confidence.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINISHED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Task 1: Added playback functionality to groundtruth window and synchronised it with the inferenced one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Task 2: Finished familiarizing and experimentation with Qt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Task 3: Finished designing the GUI to graphically select the required parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TO-DO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Task 1: Integrate the above created GUI with the suite.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Task 2: Change the GUI from ListView to dropdown.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; /&gt;Task 3: Add filtering functionality to deployer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adding playback functionalities to ground truth as well
a PR was made on the very first day of week2.And this week’s
work has been started. Most of week 2’s work was on improving
the GUI of the suite, which was built using Qt. As I was not
familiar with this framework,some time(Max 3 days) was alloted
to learn and experiment with Qt in the proposal itself.
Everything went smoothly untill now.&lt;br /&gt;
After getting enough familiarity, now the bad move, I started to implement the
dropdown feature in the Suite and it wasn’t going as expected.
Because the parameters which where being passed to the function
calls to deployer , SamplerGenerationHandler ,
GenericLiveReader , GenericInferencer and other relevant header
files were in the form of QListView. Changeing at one place
required to edit the corresponding function calls with
appropiate paramaters. This combined with sudden damage of my
battery and visiting my grandmothers place had their toll on
me. Although a lot of experimentations were made it was nothing
but trash. And I got panicked as no useful code has been
produced since the initial PR has been made that week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on the same day I talked to Vinay and explained him my
situation and we had a meeting that day. We then discussed a
few things and set our priority order. This meeting not only
consoled me but also helped in regaing my confidence back. And
then I started my work on implementing a pop up that would ask
us to provide the required parameters(datasetPath,netCfg etc)
if not provided a config file while starting the app. And I was
able to complete the GUI of the pop-up before week2 ‘s meeting
with my mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the app has the following interface, will be editing
as a few other parameters are also required to run
evaluator,detectors etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/hacker-blog/img/week_2.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; alt=&quot;drawing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final note: Although slight delay was expected the damage of
my laptop battery and my unplanned visit to my grand parents
house delayed the work by 2 more days. But thanks to my mentors
for their help, now I guess I can complete my as tasks
mentioned in my proposal without any hindrances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Playback options for DetectionSuite</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;week-1-adding-playback-functionalities-to-detectionsuite&quot;&gt;Week 1: Adding Playback functionalities to DetectionSuite&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;task-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Task 1: Done implementing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;pause&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; functionality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Task 2: Done adding trackbar&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Task 3: Done adding playback rates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; class=&quot;task-list-item-checkbox&quot; disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; checked=&quot;checked&quot; /&gt;Task 4: Finished week1’s proposed tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;new-features&quot;&gt;New Features!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have deployed your precious weights on a video and are
  waiting for it to detect something inportant to you (may be
some special “class”), and it gets detected, Now if you are
very happy and want to freeze that moment for eternity, you
could do that using the new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;pause&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are deploying it on a really boring video but you
  cannot risk missing  any of it, A good news, you could now
  increase your playback speed so that you could watch the
  inferenced video at 1.5x/2x or even higher rates !&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now suppose that you are drinking hot coffee and spilled it
  bymistake , in the process you missed the crucial part of
  your video which you are inferencing , No worries you can
  noww slide backward and watch it again!!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;As described in the proposal ,the first week of my GSOC
 was dedicated to adding new playback functionalities
 mentioned above like pause , playback rates , and trackbar
 to the DetectionSuite. They have been implemented in the
 form of class definitions in playback.hpp it’s
 implementations in playback.cpp.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;work-distribution&quot;&gt;Work Distribution&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting 1-2 days were spent searching different available
methods on how to implement these features i.e. whether to
integrate the deployer withint the suite by making space for it
or to leave it as is and add the feature to the OpenCV window
or create a new Qt window that would show this. Due to too much
enthusiasm in the early stage I thought of going with the last
option of create a new Qt window and display it there.Then I
spent a day on learning Qt. But only while going through the
tutorials I understood that this is not something which is done
overnight and I should stick to something which I can pull of
in time and also so that I can go through more Qt tutorials
while working as most of my Week 2 is based on it. Then it took
a day and half on creating and experimenting the playback
header files on a simple video to check how it is funcitoning.
Everything was working fine until the Integration Day (when i
was required to integrate my header file with suite) came. I
could not even compile my code as I was adding only the header
file of the new functionalities in the CMakeList.txt. I got so
frustrated due to continous compile fails that I was
overlooking that part evertime I was checking the cmake file.
Thanks to Sergio I cooled down a bit and after spending more
than three hours on that I realized where I went wrong. After
that again experimentation started as to where I should include
my header file and call functions. And luckily I was able to
pull this off before my meeting with mentors.&lt;br /&gt;
/hacker-blog&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;upcoming-work&quot;&gt;Upcoming work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After discussing with mentors , few changes were proposed by
them, like to stop inferencing when paused, add playback
functionalities to the ground truth aswell and sync them both
and the already planned week 2.&lt;/p&gt;
