# Introduction
DetectionSuite is a tool which can not only be used to test/deploy
object detection models but also to generate large datasets required
to train them .The main aim of the project project was to add new features to DetectionSuite which would enhance the user experience , to allow users label large amounts of data and to create a ROS Node of the tool to expand it's reach.

# Improvements & Suggestions
1. Add support to Darknet
2. Succesfully create a debian package
3. Add support to store the labeled data in many other standard formats , currently being stored in a JSON string.
4. Create a GUI application for labeling functionality (currently using deployer's interface ) where the users can select the dataset
format.

# My Experience with JDE
It obviously was a wonderful experience to work with JDE organization.
I got to learn many things like how GUI interfaces are made using Qt,
how different components of the code are brought together using CMake,
how debian packages work and how they are built ,gained experience
using ROS,and hell lot about different errors. This is the first time
I got to use **C++** as the developing language in this large a
project and it was awesome. Earlier I had no clue about the OOPs
concepts of C++ have used it javascript only till then , but thanks to
community bonding period I successfully got away with the basics and
bigger thanks to the coding period where I got to test those concepts
in real world projects. Yeah, there would have been a next level of
satisfaction had I built a debain package of this tool , it was the
cherry on top of the cake. But no worries , I got to learn how things
are done under the hood. And GSoC is finished so what .... I can still
contribute to the organization and will definitely finish building the
debian package soon. Forgot to mention , this semester I am working on
my undergrad project and guess what.... I will get to use the tool
that I contributed to, to generate training data for drones and to
add object tracking feature to the tool to further ease the process of
labeling data. In short this project not only helped me learn getting
better when I was participating in GSoC , but also after it , and it
was great experience working with JDE robotics :)

# Acknowledgements
I have no words that can describe how grateful I am to my mentors - **Vinay** and **Sergio**, for all their support, for being extremely helpful and listen with patience to every one of my problems. Without them this project would have been a lot more harder to work on.  
I am also thankful to **Jose Maria** Sir and **JDE** Organisation for the opportunity to work on this project, which helped me learn a lot in such a short period.
