title: Creating a debian package
published: true

# Here's where I messed up
The idea was to wrap up all the work done till rosnode part and package it into
a debian file , so that the end user can install it with just a single command.
The idea is super cool , but here's what the problem is , I have no prior knowledge
on how to package things , have installed things using `dpkg` but never have built
any package using it. As I had no prior knowledge on this part , I did the most
obvious thing that anyone else in my place would have done..... I googled it .
And tried out the first things that were mentioned in **stackoverflow** , and
hurrah , it didn't work . Though I was succesfull in creating a debian package
using `CPack` , it was not doing anything much other than installing the files
that were mentioned in the `CMAKE` file , and I realised this very soon
(sarcasm. took quite sometime). After realising spending enough time on internet
and trying out quite a few blogs , I decided to read the tutorials and documentation
from the debian site itself . And it was the best thing to do , wish started it a
lot earlier, but then , better late then never. Here comes the learning curve ,
I did not understand even 20% of what the tutorials were speaking of, but everytime
I read it the meaning changed , things started to make sense now ,and I was understanding
what was being said. Nice but I did not have much time.  
So heres how it works , in super simple words to build a super simple package :
1. Download the source code. Also have the compressed version of it in the same parent
directory.
2. Run `debmake` command inside the source code directory. This will create a
directory named `debian` , which has all the files that needs to edited before
proceeding further.
3. After editing the `debian/control` and `debian/rules` , all we need to do is
run `debuild`.
If everything goes buttery smooth, you will have a `.deb` file waiting for you in
the same parent directory as that of the source code . There are alot of things
to talk about , but for now we will concentrate on `control` and `rules` file.
These are the files that you need to take care , which when done, everything else
gets to their places automatically.  
`control` file will have all the information regarding the package , like it's
dependencies, maintainer's name,contact info ,patches, type,priority , description,etc.  
`rules` file on the other hand will have the information on how to build and install
the debian package. We can customize it accordingly to suit our needs.  
In general for projects that uses `CMake` as their build system :
1. mkdir obj-x86_64-linux-gnu
2. cd obj-x86_64-linux-gnu
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. make install
is the usual way of building the project and if the `rules` files are not tampered
it uses `dh_auto_install` command to build the debian package, which follows
roughly the same outline as mentioned above. I have tried it with a simple hello
world program and have succesfully created debian package for the same. But when  
tried with DetectionSuite the `make` command was failing due to some reason.

The above error was popping up when I was trying to run `debuild` , but was able
to compile succesfully when was using `cmake` and `make` directly. So this is where
my project halted for now. Hopefully will soon be able to figure out why the above
error is popping up while running dh_auto_install and not when compiled directly.
