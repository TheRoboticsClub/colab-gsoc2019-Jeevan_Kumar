**FINISHED**
- [x] Task 1: 95% support to Original Darknet

**TO-DO**
- [ ] Task 1: Complete the remaining 5% along with adjustable
              bounding boxes.

# First half of week 5
Thanks to last weeks meeting where I was explained how does
cmake work, especially what libraries meant. So after that
there was no trouble in understanding the code. Rough overview
- First search for the source files and create a library of them.
- Second search for the extra files that are developed by JDE and do the same.
- Third repeat the above with examples as well.
- After creating a shared library pass their path/ store them in
their respective variables that was present in root CMake.(Had trouble implementing the second suggestion).
What was the trouble exactly ?? Well the variable wasn't storing
the shared libraries in them , then after surfing the intenet
for a while came across **PARENT** flag, no luck even after
that. So I tried to implement the first suggested way , i.e.
store them at some place then later search them using
**FIND_LIBRARY()** function call ....and it worked !!. But
shouldn't celebrate yet as the main part is , Does the libraries
that are being loaded have all the function calls in them ??
Now this part was slightly troubling me. Like last time I still
couldn't get past this error
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/week_4_err.png" width="750" height ="350" alt="drawing">
, but unlike last time I now know why exactly is that happening.
So instead of trying to pass the path of original darknet I
passed path to JDE/darknet. The same error still popped up. This
time I had no clue why was it showing **undefine reference to**
error, as they are defined in the JDE/darknet unlike the
original one. But one thing was clear , the error was same no
matter whose source files are loaded. So I guess the order in
which things are being done might have something to do with
this. But as enough time was already spent I thought to finish
this weeks work soon as this week I need not learn anything new
but rather can start coding immediatly and was also confident
to pull this off even before the deadline so as to come back
again to deal with this.

# Second Half of Week 5
 This weeks work was to make the bounding boxes adjustable i.e.
one can drag the corners of the rectangle and adjust them using
their mouse. The challenging part was, as to which file should
I modify. I had two options 1.)RectRegion.cpp or 2.) Sample.cpp
. I went with RectRegion.cpp first, but it wasn't going that
well , so I then switched to Sample.cpp which was a lot cleaner
than the previous one. So as of now I got access to the
variable that needs to be updated and the value as well. But
the problem is that , the variable which I found isn't just any
normal variable but a **const** one. And I was carelessly
updating it and everytime I did that I was ending up with
**Segmentation fault**. After spending time with it I realised
where I was going wrong.  
Hoping to finish this 2 days before the deadline :).
