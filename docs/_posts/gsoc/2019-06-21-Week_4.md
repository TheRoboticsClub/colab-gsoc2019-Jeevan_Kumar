# How it started
This week , my task was to shift the inferencer support from
***JDE/darknet*** to ***darknet*** . More elaboratly , as of
now, DetectionSuite is using a modified fork of darknet which
has few extra call back functions/header files which makes the
it slightly better and easier to use when compared to the
original one , and one is expected to install this fork if
he/she wants to use Darknet as their inferencing framework.  
So I divided my task into the following sub-tasks:
- Finding and adding the extra files to the new directory
- Integrate the newly created directory with the suite.


# Finding the extra files
At first attempt I was naively looking for the files through my
editors **TreeView**. After finding a few files , I obviously
felt that I might be missing something, and guess what....
Yeah you are right , I googled it . And this can be done in
much more simpler and efficient way (One could also get the
lines along with their line numbers), this sure was awesome ,
and I filtered the only the missing files as of now and added
them to the newly created directory. Well this was easy and
I also leart something interesting.  
Now , even more interesting part, **integration** .

# Integrate the newly created directory with the suite.
Integrations always *beep*. And my knowledge on CMake was
similar to someone who could code nothing but **Hello World**.
So I began watching [this cool playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yFPO1ofyF0&list=PLK6MXr8gasrGmIiSuVQXpfFuE1uPT615s)
on youtube. After watching this I felt I can conquer the world
. But only after I started my invasion I met
***Mr.Fatal Error*** and ***Mr.Undefined Reference Error***.
## Formaly
  While trying to build it I'm passing the path to the darket
inferencer, which will later be used to search for header files.
 So far so good, but while including the directories of darknet
 I was getting
 `fatal error : No such file or directory`  
Now again a search team has been released by my brain on how to
include src files of other projects, is even doing that the
right way or can it be done much more simply/elegantly. After
searching and trying out a few things , this new error showed up

Before starting again , I thought I was missing something. So I
started my experimentation with different hello World
libraries , how to add and link them. Although they were a bit
confusing, using them made it more clear. But still no luck as
of now. Hopefully this will be resolved soon during this
week's meeting.
In short my week can be summerized nicely using the below two
pics.
