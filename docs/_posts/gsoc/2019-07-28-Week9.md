# Connecting trains , Registration and Room shiftings
It is finally over , a three months long nice summer vacation . And I like most
people in India took a train to reach Kanpur . The most annoying thing about
my journey is , there is no direct train to reach Kanpur from Vizag (my hometown),
i.e. I need to board two trains , one from Vizag to Bhubaneshwar , wait here for a
few hours and board the next train from Bhubaneshwar to Kanpur , and the whole
journey needs you to spend 35-37 hours of your life . After reaching my college ,
we Senior Undergrad students are required to shift to our new dorms . Now comes
the hard part , my cycle was in no condition to be used , and the new dorm is the
fathest one from every frekking place which we are required to visit for the next
1 year . And without a cycle the chances of your survival here are less , if not
survival , your attendance for sure . And I did all the shifting ,
registration , required shopping without my cycle . At the end of the day I couldn't
feel my legs , it was as if I dipped them in ice cold water . I guess I missed something ,
forgot to tell you at what time I reached my college , it was around 00:30 (mid-night 12)
and by the time we had our dinnner and bath it was 1:00 AM , I along with my other friend
was required to share a bed, as we will be alloted our rooms the next morning . And guess
what ..... after about 4 hours of sleep it was morning already . Had I sleept any longer I
might not have got the room where I'm staying now . So that ends the first half of the week.

# The other half
I went through ROS tutorials once again , as the last time I used ROS was during my
semester. And made the rough roadmap of how it can be implemented . Later discussed the
same with my mentors during today's meeting. The particular task of developing a ROS-Node
was divided into two weeks. First week was for knowledge gathering and the second one for
implementation. The delay was included in the timeline so I guess there is nothing to worry
.
