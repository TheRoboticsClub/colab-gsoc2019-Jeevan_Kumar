**FINISHED**
- [x] Task 1: This new feature to select missing parameters

**TO-DO**
- [ ] Task 1: Yet to support original Darknet.

# About and Motivation behind the feature
Well you might already know that a config file is required to
run the suite, now what if you don't know what parameters to
include in the config file , as someone has already faced a
(similar issue)[https://github.com/JdeRobot/DetectionSuite/issues/144]
we thought of implementing a gui feature which would allow the
user to select the required parameters on the go if they
missed to pass one.  

# Approach
Thanks to week2 , when I learnt how to use **Qt** , and once
you know how to use it , the rest is simple event listners
callbacks , yeah I wouldn't say the same about integration
though. I agree it's not hard but still , I am little rusty with
CMake. Thanks to my mentors for pointing out where things were
going wrong.  

# Results
The following video was made when an empty config file was
passed.
