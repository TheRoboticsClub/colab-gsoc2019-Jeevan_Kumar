Hi there ! I am Jeevan (a.k.a. sleep_404) pursuing my bachelors
in the field of Aerospace engineering from Indian Institute of
Technology Kanpur. Although I am slightly inclined towards
robotics, am interested in anything about technology in general.  
This blog is maintained by me as part of GSOC programme, to help
others and myself in keeping track of the work done during summer.
Have a good day ;)
